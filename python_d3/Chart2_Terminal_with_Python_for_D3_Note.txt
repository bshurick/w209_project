To run a Python web server:
Open up a new terminal window.
Via the command line, navigate into the directory that you want served. For example, if your project folder is in your Desktop folder on your Mac, you could type: cd ~/Desktop/project-folder.
Enter python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8888 &.
(This will work with Python version 2.x, but in Python versions 3.0 and newer, SimpleHTTPServer has been removed. For Python 3.x, just replace SimpleHTTPServer with http.server in the command.)

This will activate the server on port 8888. Switch back to your web browser and visit the following URL: http://localhost:8888/.
