<!--- load the d3.js library, link on API webpage talks about what is used in the script -->
<!--- useful to read source code if need more sophisticated stuff or things don't work -->
<script src="d3.js"></script>

<!--- the separate JS code below, which uses D3, can be used now that the d3.js library is loaded -->
<script>

// object vs. variable, where margin is an object
var margin = {top: 20, right: 20, bottom: 30, left: 40},
    width = 960 - margin.left - margin.right,
    height = 500 - margin.top - margin.bottom;
    
// define helper function to format with no decimal places
// d3.format is a function inside d3, formatPercent is now a function, if given a number, it will return a formatted string
var formatPercent = d3.format(".0%");

// define a scale (way to map input to output values, usually numbers in data space into screen space
// (e.g., 0-100 data displayed to the height of visualizations on screen) 
// give the function a number, and scale does the rest, allowing for dynamic coding
// define ordinal scale (x axis with different categories)
// all range functions specify output domain, rangeRoundBands says we want a range for each bar
var x = d3.scale.ordinal()
    .rangeRoundBands([0, width], .1, .2);

// SVG y-coordinates are the opposite of expected, 0 is at the top, not bottom
// d3.scale.linear() is a single name for one function: d3.library, the scale module, and within that module, the linear function
// just convention that we separate with .
// we call with no args, and it returns a function. y is now a function.
var y = d3.scale.linear()
    .range([height, 0]);

// x-axis component. scales give functions to map input to output, but no visual components
// so we use the axis component, where .scale(x) tells the axis what to use and where things should be. 
// here is a scale, and we want an axis.
// call the axis function, then call scale function on that, and so on (method chaining)
// call a function, immediately call another function on it
// they implement internal modifications, but all return the chained axis component

var xAxis = d3.svg.axis()
    .scale(x)
    .orient("bottom");

// formatPercent is passed as a function, telling the yAxis function this is what should be called every time we want a tick value
// D3 places the value through the function and displays the result
var yAxis = d3.svg.axis()
    .scale(y)
    .orient("left")
    .tickFormat(formatPercent);

// now set up the SVG container for the entire visualization
// select DOM element of body (main part of HTML doc), and append SVG
// SVG is a DOM-based format as well as text-based image format, very similar to HTML, nesting elements inside it
// SVG is like source code, interpreted by the web browser as text-based image format, especially instructions for what should be rendered 
// HTML says here's some text, whereas SVG says here's where a line should be
// below, we write similar to what we had above, nesting elements in each other
// JS does the same thing, but dynamically
// set up the document
// important to note the body must already exist, this JS must come after body has been defined

var svg = d3.select("body").append("svg")
    .attr("width", width + margin.left + margin.right)
    .attr("height", height + margin.top + margin.bottom)
    
// g stands for group, as in a way to group things together in SVG
// anything that comes below that will appended, nested in this g element, and will have the same transformation applied
  .append("g")
  
// to this group element, apply a transformation, which is the translation, now shift the g element to right and bottom
// so wide margins exist on top and left
    .attr("transform", "translate(" + margin.left + "," + margin.top + ")");

// pattern we commonly see, static part above and then dynamic part below
// static part above is independent of any data we want to show
// defined the size of the output, scales, axes, height, and width, and structure of SVG

// d3.csv function below with two args
// the callback function returns the data
// in JS, load additional stuff, you can call AJAX (async javascript requests)
// browser fires a request to get the data, and immediately returns to execution without waiting for data
// the callback says as soon as we get back the request, call this function on whatever we get back
// the entire rest of the code is part of the callback function

// any requests that rely on data to be returned, need to occur in the callback function
// callback has two args, error is usually null id data is ok and loads, data is set to actual data (e.g., API documentation)

d3.csv("PPREG4_PPGENDER_I10_concat.csv", function(error, data) {

// this data needs to be post-processed, csv doesn't define data types, so we need to define them
// json does allow us to define data types

// data is an array
// set data and interpret field as a number, that is what the + does
// if interpret as strings, then 1, 10, 2, . . .
  data.forEach(function(d) {
    d.Weighted_Pct = +d.Weighted_Pct;
  });

// now finish set up of the scales
// now we tell what the input looks like
// for each element, take the category value, and specify we want all of these in the domain
// map function has nothing to do with D3, takes a single argument, specifically maps over a single element of array
// takes one row of csv data, and returns value of category column
// data is an array of rows with two columns, and map function result is an array of category values
// and we give that array to x as the domain

  x.domain(data.map(function(d) { return d.Category; }));
  
// now we do the same for the y scale, but only need to tell the extreme values
// takes array of two elements, min set to 0, and max value taken from the data
// d3.max takes the array, and computes the max over the entire array (e.g., API documentation)

  //y.domain([0, d3.max(data, function(d) { return d.Weighted_Pct; })]);
  y.domain([0, 1]);
	
// now we have specified how D3 should map input to output values

// append another g element, giving two classes, x and axis
// this is important because CSS defines particular styles for class
// set attribute of name class (special in that browser knows it) to the classes, 'x axis'

// translate moves g element to where we want the xAxis to appear
// call and put the xAxis component on this g element

  svg.append("g")
      .attr("class", "x axis")
      .attr("transform", "translate(0," + height + ")")
      .call(xAxis);

  svg.append("g")
      .attr("class", "y axis")
      
      // no transformation necessary as it already starts where we want in the top left
      .call(yAxis)
      
      // remaining code adds a label to the axis
      // append text element
      // place in the right position, rotate by 90%, set y and dy (delta y) attributes, dy is the offset from the position.
    .append("text")
      //.attr("transform", "rotate(-90)")
      .attr("transform", "translate(0," + (-30) + ")")
      .attr("y", 10)
      
      // unit em is the width, and .71em is taking 71% of the width
      .attr("dy", ".8em")
      
      // right rather than left align the text
      .style("text-anchor", "top")
      .text("% Spiritual or Very Spiritual");

// block of code below now draws the actual bars, using the very common D3 selection pattern
// on an abstract conceptual level, selections work as the following:
// first step is selection of DOM elements, second step is the binding of the data
// enter, update, and exit selection
// 1. enter selection is present in the data but not in the DOM (so nothing to represent it yet)
// 2. update selection contains things for which we have both data and elements in the DOM (for representation that can be updated)
// 3. exit selection contains the things for which we have DOM elements but no data (exit from visualization bec no data for them, so don't show anymore DOM elemesnts)
// this selection stuff is core to D3 (lot of tutorials) 

// 3 little circles tutorial on selection stuff (high level with illustrations) 

// if we have drawn the bar chart, and need to update the bars if new data

// select all the elements of class bar, but to start off with there will be none
// first time this is run the selection will be empty 
  svg.selectAll(".bar")
  
// 2nd step is to take the variable data (an array) and bind the elements to the selection
// take each element in array and try to match to one element in the DOM selection, but won't match because no DOM elements
// thus we will be in the enter selection
      .data(data)
      
// now give the enter selection (as we know both the update and exit functions will be empty)
// after one function call, we can't get the other elements from update and exit selections
// we have nothing on the page, so we want to add or append DOM elements now
// it appends a single rect element for each data element in the array (D3 is a selection or array of elements)
    .enter().append("rect")
    
// it just sets the class attribute to bar, and tells web browser see if anything to apply to those elements (doesn't apply any styles itself)
      .attr("class", "bar")
      
// now we are operating on the array, this is true after we call .enter
// now determine the position of the x
// take the category value, place in the x scale, and return what comes out of it as the position or x-coordinate
      .attr("x", function(d) { return x(d.Category); })
      
// width of the bars are set to all the same, and number of bands is determined by number of categories earlier
      .attr("width", x.rangeBand())
      .attr("y", function(d) { return y(d.Weighted_Pct); })
// bars are defined in y position, with y-coordinate set at the top of the bar
// we're telling SVG where the bar ends, not where it starts, so we compute the height accordingly so it ends at exactly 0
      .attr("height", function(d) { return height - y(d.Weighted_Pct); });

// the rest of the code is to sort the bars
// select the input element, and tell D3 when this changes, call the change function
// on is a function that installs event handlers, passing change as a function, not calling the change function
  d3.select("input").on("change", change);

// call setTimeout function to install a callback after 2000ms
  var sortTimeout = setTimeout(function() {
    d3.select("input").property("checked", true).each(change);
  }, 2000);

// change function clears the timeout
  function change() {
    clearTimeout(sortTimeout);

	// set up a new x.domain, changing the x position of the bars and modifying the x-scale
	// just use the scale, and depending how we want to sort, the underlying scale is changed
	// the category that shows first appears on far left, and so on
	// take orig data and sort it 
	// because changing order of data, then changing order of categories, thus changing order of bars
    // call JS sort function on data, which takes a callback, 
    // this.checked is the condition on whether the user box is checked
    var x0 = x.domain(data.sort(this.checked
        // this is shorter way of writing if/else
    	// if this.checked is true, then ? line is used
    	// sorts bars based on height 
        ? function(a, b) { return b.Weighted_Pct - a.Weighted_Pct; }
        // if this.checked is false, then : line is used
        // sorts bars by category label
        : function(a, b) { return d3.ascending(a.Category, b.Category); })
        // then the result, the sorted array, is mapped to a function that extracts the category
        .map(function(d) { return d.Category; }))
        // change existing scale and copy the entire scale object so we don't overwrite 
        // anything about x can be changed without changing the orig x scale
        // copy is not necessary
        .copy();

// D3 showreel
// more selections on the data might be easier to program
// just a bunch of check boxes to select subsets of the data rather than interactive
// step from updating to animating is relatively small

// to tell this coherent story, use feature X, Y, etc.

// select all the elements of class bar and sort the DOM elements, not the original data items
    svg.selectAll(".bar")
    // taking existing elements with data bound to it, sorting based on the new x0 scale we defined, which give us the new positions of the bars
	// these are the rect type but we are selecting the class (rect.bar would have the same effect, or selectAll("rect") works too
	// SVG elements are kind of generic, so class is helpful to use to avoid confusion to distinguish from other things
        .sort(function(a, b) { return x0(a.Category) - x0(b.Category); });
        
	// few rows above might not be necessary, not changing the position, just swapping the elements around in the document
	// order shown in SVG determines order they are shown, only matters if overlap each other
	
	// define a transition: animation between two different states, moving the bars around
	// transition on SVG, duration will be 750ms, delay is between start and end, and depends on the index
	// d is the data bound to element, and i is the index
    var transition = svg.transition().duration(750),
        delay = function(d, i) { return i * 50; };
	
	// select all rects, all elements of class bar, and apply a delay
	// then set the new x attribute through the new x0 scale we define
	// this is everything we need for the animation
	// in existing state, bars are already there, here's the final value, D3 will interpret the start and end state
    transition.selectAll(".bar")
        .delay(delay)
        .attr("x", function(d) { return x0(d.Category); });

	// this does the same for the x-axis
	// x.axis component has changed, is called on transition, so need to animate
    transition.select(".x.axis")
        .call(xAxis)
    // not all the tick labels move immediately
      .selectAll("g")
        .delay(delay);
  }
});
